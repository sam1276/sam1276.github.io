        <h1>What is a programming language </h1>
        <p>
            A programming language is a set of rules and syntax used to write computer programs.
            <br><br>
            It enables programmers to communicate instructions to computers and create software applications.
            <br><br>
            Different programming languages have unique features and purposes, tailored for specific tasks.
            <br><br>
            Programmers choose the most appropriate language based on project requirements and their familiarity with
            the language.

        <h1>Importance of Progamming language</h1>
        <p>
            Programming languages enable communication between humans and computers, allowing programmers to provide
            instructions and define algorithms.

            <br><br>

            They are fundamental for software development, enabling the creation of applications, websites, and other
            digital solutions. <br><br>
            Programming languages foster problem-solving and innovation, encouraging developers to find creative
            solutions to complex challenges.

            <br><br>

            Different languages serve specific purposes, such as web development, data analysis, and artificial
            intelligence, catering to diverse needs.

            <br><br>

            Choosing the right language impacts developer productivity, code maintainability, and the overall success of
            a project.

            Why can't Computer understand English or Hindi
        </h2>
        <p>
            Computers can't directly understand natural languages like English or Hindi because they are complex,
            ambiguous, and not designed for machine processing. Instead, computers require programming languages with
            strict rules for clear communication and execution of tasks.
