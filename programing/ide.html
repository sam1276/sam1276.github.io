            What's IDE
        </h1>
        <p>
            IDE stands for "Integrated Development Environment." It is a software application that provides
            comprehensive tools and features to software developers for writing, testing, and debugging code. An IDE
            typically includes a code editor, compiler or interpreter, build automation tools, and a debugger, all
            integrated into a single user-friendly interface.
            <br><br>

            The primary purpose of an IDE is to enhance the developer's productivity by streamlining the development
            process and providing a cohesive environment for coding, testing, and deploying applications. IDEs are
            tailored to specific programming languages or frameworks, and they often offer code completion, syntax
            highlighting, error checking, version control integration, and other features to make programming more
            efficient and enjoyable. Examples of popular IDEs include <a href="">Visual Studio</a>, <a
                href="">Eclipse</a>, and <a href="">PyCharm</a>.

        <h1>Compiler</h1>
        <p>
            A compiler is a software tool that translates high-level programming language code into machine code or
            bytecode.
            <br><br>
            It takes the entire source code as input and processes it through various stages like lexical analysis,
            syntax analysis, and semantic analysis.
            <br><br>
            The compiler performs optimizations to improve the efficiency of the generated code.
            <br><br>
            After the compilation process, the compiler produces an output file known as an executable or binary file.
            <br><br>
            The resulting executable file contains the translated machine code that the computer's processor can
            directly understand and execute.
            <br><br>
            Commonly used in languages like <a href="">C</a>, <a href="">C++</a>, and <a href="">Rust</a>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>
            Interpreter
        </h1>
        <p>
            An interpreter is a software tool that reads and executes high-level programming language code directly,
            line by line.
            <br><br>
            It processes the source code on-the-fly, interpreting each line and executing corresponding instructions
            immediately.
            <br><br>
            Interpreted languages allow for quicker feedback during development as errors are detected and reported as
            soon as they occur.
            <br><br>
            However, interpreted languages may have slightly slower performance compared to compiled languages since
            they interpret the code each time it runs.
            <br><br>
            Examples of interpreted programming languages include <a href="">Python</a>, <a href="">JavaScript</a>, <a href="">Ruby</a>, and <a href="">PHP</a>, making them highly
            accessible and versatile for rapid development and scripting tasks.
        </p>

            Debugger

                Debugging
            </span>
            Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software code to ensure it runs correctly and efficiently. It enhances code reliability and performance.
            </p>
       
        
        <p>
            A debugger is a software tool used to identify and fix errors, bugs, and unexpected behavior in code. <br><br>
            It is integrated into an IDE or can be a standalone program. <br><br>
            Developers can set breakpoints in the code to pause execution and inspect variable values during runtime. <br><br>
            The debugger allows step-by-step execution, line-by-line, to understand the flow of the program. <br><br>
            It assists in verifying code correctness and understanding program behavior, making the debugging process more efficient.

            Extensions and Plugins
        </h1>
        <p>
            Extensions and plugins are additional software components that enhance the functionality of an IDE or text editor. <br><br>
They can be installed to extend support for specific programming languages, frameworks, or development workflows. <br><br>
Extensions provide extra tools, features, and language-specific support. <br><br>
Plugins may offer version control integration, code snippets, collaboration capabilities, and more. <br><br>
Developers can customize their development environment by installing extensions and plugins tailored to their specific needs, making the IDE or text editor more powerful and suitable for their particular development tasks.
