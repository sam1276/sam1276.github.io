            File Handling in Python
        </h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            In Python, file handling refers to the process of working with files, which can include reading from and
            writing to files. File handling is essential for various tasks like data storage, data retrieval,
            configuration management, and more. Python provides built-in functions and methods for file handling, making
            it easy to work with files.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>
            Here are some common file handling operations in Python:
        </h2>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>
            Opening a File
        </h1>
        <p class="nomar">
            You can use the `open()` function to open a file. It takes two arguments: the file name and the mode in
            which you want to open the file (e.g., read, write, append, binary, etc.)
        </p>
        <div class="box">
            <code class="synt">
                # Open a file for reading <br>
                file = open("example.txt", "r") <br>
                 <br><br>
                # Open a file for writing (creates a new file if it doesn't exist) <br>
                file = open("example.txt", "w") <br>
                 <br><br>
                # Open a file for appending (adds data to the end of the file) <br>
                file = open("example.txt", "a") <br>                
            </code>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>
            Reading from a File
        </h1>
        <p class="nomar">
            You can use various methods like `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()` to read data from a file.
        </p>
        <div class="box"><code class="synt">
            # Reading the entire file <br>
            data = file.read() <br>
<br><br>
            # Reading a single line <br>
            line = file.readline() <br>
<br><br>
            # Reading all lines into a list <br>
            lines = file.readlines() <br>

        </code></div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>
            Writing to a File
        </h1>
        <p class="nomar">
            You can use the `write()` method to write data to a file.
        </p>
        <div class="box"><code class="synt">
            file.write("Hello, World!")
        </code></div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>
            Closing a File
        </h1>
        <p class="nomar">
            After working with a file, it's essential to close it using the close() method to release system resources.
        </p>
        <div class="box"><code class="synt">
            file.close()

        </code></div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>
            Using a Context Manager
        </h1>
        <p>
            It's a good practice to use the `with` statement when working with files. It automatically closes the file
            when you're done with it, ensuring that resources are properly managed.
        </p>

        <h1>
            File Modes
        </h1>
        <div>
            <h2>
                `"r"` (Read Mode):
            </h2>
            <p>
                1] Opens the file for reading. <br>
                2] If the file doesn't exist, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`. <br>
                3] Default mode if not specified explicitly. <br>
                Example: `open("example.txt", "r")`

            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>
                `"w"` (Write Mode):
            </h2>
            <p>
                1] Opens the file for writing. <br>
                2] If the file exists, it truncates (clears) its content. <br>
                3] If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file. <br>
                Example: `open("example.txt", "w")`
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>
                `"a"` (Append Mode):
            </h2>
            <p>
                1] Opens the file for writing, but appends data to the end of the file. <br>
                2] If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file. <br>
                Example: open("example.txt", "a")
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>
                `"x"` (Exclusive Creation Mode):
            </h2>
            <p>
                1] Creates a new file. <br>
                2] If the file already exists, it raises a `FileExistsError`. <br>
                Example: `open("new_file.txt", "x")`
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            These modes are used when opening files with the open() function in Python. They determine how the file can
            be accessed and what operations can be performed on it. It's essential to choose the appropriate mode for
            your specific file handling needs to ensure data integrity and security.
        </p>
        <div>
            <h1>
                2 in one mode
            </h1>
            <p>
                Python provides three additional file modes: `"w+"`, `"r+"`, and `"a+"`. These modes combine both
                reading and writing operations, allowing you to both read from and write to a file. Here's a brief explanation of each:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>
                `"w+"` (Write and Read Mode):
            </h2>
            <p>
                1] Opens the file for both reading and writing. <br>
                2] If the file exists, it truncates (clears) its content. <br>
                3] If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file. <br>
                4] You can use `read()` and `write()` methods to perform both read and write operations. <br>
                Example: `open("example.txt", "w+")`
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>
                `"r+"` (Read and Write Mode):
            </h1>
            <p>
                1] Opens the file for both reading and writing. <br>
                2] The file must already exist; otherwise, it raises a FileNotFoundError. <br>
                3] You can use read() and write() methods to perform both read and write operations. <br>
                Example: `open("example.txt", "r+")`
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>
                `"a+"` (Append and Read Mode):
            </h1>
            <p>
                1] Opens the file for both reading and writing, with data appended to the end of the file. <br>
                2] If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file. <br>
                3] You can use `read()` and `write()` methods to perform both read and write operations. <br>
                Example: `open("example.txt", "a+")`
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            These modes are useful when you need to perform a combination of read and write operations on the same file.
            However, you should be cautious when using them to avoid unintended consequences, such as overwriting or
            losing data in the file. Always ensure that your code handles file operations correctly to maintain data
            integrity.
