            What is Internet
        </h1>
        <p>
            The internet, short for "interconnected networks," is a global network of computer networks that allows
            billions of devices, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, servers, and more, to connect and communicate
            with each other worldwide. It is a vast and complex infrastructure that enables the exchange of information,
            data, and digital content on a global scale.

            The World Wide Web (WWW), often called "the web," is a global system of interconnected web pages and digital
            resources. It operates over the internet and uses hyperlinks to allow users to navigate between documents
            and access information on different websites. The web has transformed how we access information,
            communicate, and conduct various activities online.

                A website is a collection of interconnected web pages and digital content that is accessible through a
                unique web address (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW). It is typically hosted on a web server and can
                include various types of content, such as text, images, videos, and interactive features. Websites serve
                a wide range of purposes, including providing information, facilitating online communication, offering
                e-commerce services, and sharing multimedia content. Users access websites using web browsers and can
                navigate between different pages and resources via hyperlinks. Websites play a central role in the
                online presence of businesses, organizations, individuals, and various online services.

                A webpage is a digital document displayed in a web browser. It can include text, images, videos, links,
                and interactive elements. Webpages are written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and often styled with
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for layout and design. When you access a website, you are viewing a
                collection of webpages linked together. These pages can contain a wide range of content and
                functionality, from simple text and images to complex web applications. Webpages are the building blocks
                of the World Wide Web, allowing users to access information and interact with online services.

            </h2>
            <p>
                A URL, short for Uniform Resource Locator, serves as a web address used to locate and access resources
                on the internet. It consists of several components:
                <br><br>
                <span class="parash">Scheme or Protocol:</span> This indicates how the resource should be accessed, such
                as "https://" for secure
                web pages or "ftp://" for file transfers.
                <br>
                <span class="parash">Domain or Host:</span> It specifies the web server's address or domain name where
                the resource is hosted, like
                "www.example.com."
                <br>
                <span class="parash">Port (Optional):</span> This element, separated by a colon (e.g., ":8080"),
                designates a specific endpoint on
                the server for handling the request.
                <br>
                <span class="parash">Path:</span> The path component outlines the directory or file structure within the
                server where the resource
                resides, often starting with a forward slash ("/").
                <br>
                <span class="parash">Query (Optional):</span> It begins with a question mark ("?") and contains
                parameters for data exchange with
                the resource, often in key-value pairs.
                <br>
                <span class="parash">Fragment (Optional):</span> This part, indicated by a hash symbol ("#"), specifies
                a particular section or
                anchor within a web page.
                <br><br>
                URLs play a vital role in web navigation, enabling precise access to websites, pages, and files on the
                internet.

            <p>

                A domain name is a user-friendly web address used to access websites on the internet. It consists of a
                unique name (e.g., "example") and a top-level domain (e.g., ".com"). Domain names help people find and
                interact with websites, replacing numerical IP addresses with memorable names. They are essential for
                branding, online presence, and web navigation. Domain names are registered through domain registrars and
                serve various purposes, including websites and email addresses.

            <p>
                A web server is a computer or software application responsible for storing and serving web content to
                users' web browsers. It receives requests for web pages and files from users, processes those requests,
                and sends back the requested content. Web servers use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for
                communication and can handle both static and dynamic web content. They play a central role in delivering
                websites and web applications to users on the internet. Well-known web server software includes Apache,
                Nginx, and Microsoft IIS, each with its own strengths and configurations.

            <p>
                ISP stands for "Internet Service Provider." An ISP is a company or organization that provides access to
                the internet to individuals, businesses, and other entities. ISPs offer various types of internet
                connections, such as broadband, DSL, cable, fiber-optic, and wireless connections. They play a crucial
                role in enabling users to connect to the internet, access websites, send and receive emails, and engage
                in online activities. ISPs typically charge users a subscription fee for their internet services and may
                offer additional services like web hosting, email, and technical support. Some well-known ISPs include
                Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Spectrum.

                Web development languages, also known as programming or scripting languages, are used to create web
                applications, websites, and web content. These languages enable developers to design the appearance,
                functionality, and interactivity of web pages.

                <p>
                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundational language for creating the structure and content
                    of web pages. It uses tags and elements to organize text, images, links, and more on a webpage. HTML
                    is crucial for web development and works alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
                    It forms the structure of web content and is supported by modern web browsers for consistent
                    display.

                <p>
                    CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental web technology used for styling web content. It
                    determines how HTML elements should appear on a web page, controlling aspects like fonts, colors,
                    layout, and spacing. CSS promotes a separation of design from content, enhancing website maintenance
                    and consistency. Styles can be applied inline, within HTML documents, or in external CSS files. CSS
                    plays a critical role in creating visually appealing and responsive web designs, ensuring a
                    consistent user experience across different devices and browsers. It is a core skill in web
                    development and design.

                Scripting
            </h1>
            <p>
                Scripting languages are programming languages designed for specific tasks or applications. They are
                often interpreted rather than compiled, meaning the code is executed line by line rather than being
                translated into machine code in advance.
            </p>
            <div>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Client-side scripting involves executing code within a user's web browser, primarily using JavaScript. It enhances web pages with features like interactivity, animations, and form validation without relying on constant server communication. This approach improves the user experience and allows for real-time updates. Popular frameworks like React and Angular simplify client-side development, but developers must also consider security and cross-browser compatibility.

            <div>
                <h2>
                    Server-side scripting</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                Server-side scripting is a web development approach where scripts run on the web server to create dynamic web content. These scripts, often written in languages like PHP, Python, or Java, generate content based on user input, databases, or business logic. Server-side scripting ensures security, processes data, and enhances search engine optimization (SEO). Frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Django facilitate server-side development. It complements client-side scripting to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
