        <p>
            Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that is present on the computer. It is used to connect
            different networking devices such as computers and servers to share data over the connected network. It
            provides functionality such as support for I/O interrupt, Direct Memory Access (DMA) interfaces,
            partitioning, and data transmission.
            <br><br>
            NIC is important for us to establish a wired or wireless connection over the network.
            <br><br>
            Network Interface Card is also known as Network Interface Controller, Network Adapter, Ethernet card,
            Connection card, and LAN (Local Area Network) Adapter.

            Purpose
        </h1>
        <p>
            1] NIC allows both wired and wireless communications.
            <br><br>
            2] NIC allows communications between computers connected via local area network (LAN) as well as
            communications over large-scale network through Internet Protocol (IP).
            <br><br>
            3] NIC is both a physical layer and a data link layer device, i.e. it provides the necessary hardware
            circuitry so that the physical layer processes and some data link layer processes can run on it.

            Types of NIC Cards

            1] Internal Network Cards

            Internal Network Cards
        </h1>
        <p>
            In internal networks cards, motherboard has a slot for the network card where it can be inserted. It
            requires network cables to provide network access. Internal network cards are of two types. The first type
            uses Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) connection, while the second type uses Industry Standard
            Architecture (ISA).

            External Network Cards
        </h1>
        <p>
            In desktops and laptops that do not have an internal NIC, external NICs are used. External network cards are
            of two types: Wireless and USB based. Wireless network card needs to be inserted into the motherboard,
            however no network cable is required to connect to the network. They are useful while traveling or accessing
            a wireless signal.
