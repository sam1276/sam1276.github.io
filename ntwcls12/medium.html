    <h2>Guided (wired)
    </h2>
    <p>
        Guided media is like a physical medium via which the signals are transmitted. The guided media is used to
        provide a conduit from one machine to another that can have twisted-pair, coaxial cable and fibre-optic cable.
        It is also known as Bounded media.
        <br><br>
        There are four types of Guided Media which are as follows:
        <br>
        <span class="parash">
            Twisted Pair

        <br>

        <br>
        <span class="parash">

    </p>
    <h2>
        Unguided (wireless)
    </h2>
    <p>
        Unguided transmission media are techniques that allow transmission of electromagnetic waves through a wireless
        medium or we can say without using any physical medium. It provides a mechanism for transferring electromagnetic
        waves but does not direct them.
        <br><br>
        There are three types of Unguided Transmission Media which are as follows:
        <br>
        <span class="parash">
            Microwave Transmission

            Twisted Pair Cables
        </h1>
        <p>
            As the name suggests these are two twisted pairs of cables or wires made up of insulated copper. These are
            twisted together in such a way that they run parallelly one wire is used for the transmission of data and
            the other wire is used for ground. Usually, these wires or cables are 1mm in diameter. The twisted-pair
            cable is made up of 2 copper wires (insulated) arranged in a spiral pattern. Noise interference is more
            often the problem in these cables but it can be handled by increasing the number of turns per foot of
            twisted pair cable.
            <br><br>
            <span class="para-heading">Working of twisted-pair cables</span> The twisted-pair cable has an outer jacket
            that keeps the wires together, a shield for the protection of the cable, color-coded plastic insulation to
            uniquely identify each conductor, and twisting of wires to cancel the electromagnetic waves that create
            noise interferences during the transmission of data. When current flows through the cable then a small
            circular magnetic field is created around the wire. For the connection between two devices connectors are
            needed at both ends like RJ45 for computer connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="parash">Merits</span> <br>
            - These cables are cheaper. <br>
            - The maintenance cost is low. <br>
            - It doesnâ€™t require any ground wire.

            <br>
            - The transmission rate of data is slow. <br>
            - Noise is high in these cables.

        <h1>
            Co-axial cable
        </h1>
        <p>
            The most common type of transmission media that is used in various applications like tv wires and ethernet
            connection setup also. This is a form of transmission media that consists of two conductors kept parallel to
            each other. It has a central core conductor of a solid copper wire enclosed in an insulating sheet and the
            middle core conductor is made up of copper mesh and lastly an outer metallic wrap that helps in noise
            cancellation. The whole cable is covered and protected by a plastic cover.
            <br><br>
            It is considered better than twisted-pair cables because of the higher frequency range. Coaxial cables are
            best suited for shorter distances as there are higher chances of data loss in more distances for fiber optic
            cables are best as fibers are capable of higher data transfer and with greater speed as compared to coaxial
            cables. Cost and maintenance are also less, unlike fiber optic cables. And the durability of these cables is
            more.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="para-heading">Working of Coaxial Cables</span>: Coaxial cables are made up of copper wires for
            carrying higher frequency signals this wire is covered with an insulated foil cover whenever current flows
            it maintains a constant distance between the conductor and the next layer and then a shielded wire that
            prevents the interference of noise in between the transmission and at last the plastic cover that protects
            the whole cable from any outer disturbances. Hence, a coaxial cable carries a signal in a way that when the
            current enters the center copper wire as well as the metal shield. The metal conductors at that point
            generate a magnetic field. The insulators help the signals not to come in contact with each other, they also
            the signal from outside magnetic fields. In this way, the signal is carried over larger distances without
            much loss.

        <p>
            <span class="para-heading">Coaxial Cable Standards:</span>
            These cables are categorized by their radio government (RG) ratings and each RG number denotes a unique set
            of physical specifications. Example,

            RG-59 - 75 ohm - Cable TV

            RG-58 - 50 ohm - Thin Ethernet

            <span class="parash">Merits</span> <br>

            - The cost of coaxial cables is less as compared to fiber optic cables.

            <span class="parash">Demerits</span>
            <br>
            - For long distances, the cost of these cables will be higher.
            <br>
            - The size of these cables is usually bulky because of various layers of metal
            <br> - as well as copper and plastic.
            <br>
            - The data transmission over long distances is poor.

            Fiber-optic cables
        </h1>
        <p>
            Also known as optic fiber cables are highly efficient and advanced data transmission cables that allow the
            transfer of data in a very large volume. Fiber optic cables allow data transmission with the help of
            electrical signals. These are thin pipes made up of glass or plastic known as optic fibers and data or
            information flows via light in these cables. With higher bandwidth and high-quality performance optic fiber
            cables are best suited for long-distance data transfer and communication.

        <p>
            <span class="para-heading">
                Working of fiber-optic cable
            </span>
            : Fiber optic cables carry information via light so at the transmitting side the light source is first
            encoded with data or information and then the data starts flowing in the core of the fiber optic cable in a
            completely bouncing manner with a complete internal reflection then there is cladding that helps the light
            to remain inside the cable after reaching the receiver side the data is then decoded like the original. So
            basically fiber optic is a form of transmission media for the transfer of data via light with higher
            bandwidth and a higher rate of transmission.

            It consists of five major parts named core, Cladding, Coating, Strengthening, and Outer jacket.

            - Television broadcasting These cables are very much suitable for transmitting signals for high-definition
            televisions because of their greater bandwidth and speed. <br>
            - In surgical operations in medicine, these cables are used in various fields of medicine and research
            purposes as their cost is low as compared to other cables. <br>
            - It is used in industries and in defense services also these cables are of great use. <br>
