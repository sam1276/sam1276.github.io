        Understanding Network

        <h1>What is Networking</h1>
        <p>
            Networking refers to the practice of creating and managing a system of interconnected devices, computers, or other components to facilitate communication, data sharing, and resource exchange. It involves the establishment of connections between these devices using various technologies, protocols, and networking infrastructure. Networking enables seamless interaction and collaboration among devices, ranging from local setups like home networks or office networks to larger-scale systems like the internet, which connects billions of devices globally. It plays a crucial role in modern technology, enabling efficient data transfer, communication, and access to resources across different contexts and distances.

        <h1>Network</h1>
        <p>A network is a collection of interconnected devices or computers that communicate and share resources. It
            enables data transmission and resource sharing among these connected devices, facilitating efficient
            communication and collaboration. Networks can be wired or wireless and play a fundamental role in modern
            communication and technology systems.</p>

        <h1> Types of Networks </h1>
        <h3>1] Wide Area Network (WAN)</h3>
        <h3>2] Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</h3>
        <h3>3] Local Area Network (LAN)</h3>
        <h3>4] Personal Area Network (PAN)</h3>

            <h1>Wide Area Network (WAN)</h1>
            <p>A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a type of network that encompasses an extensive geographic area, potentially spanning across cities, regions, countries, or even continents. Unlike Local Area Networks (LANs) that are confined to specific premises, WANs connect multiple LANs and other network devices over substantial distances. This is achieved using various communication technologies like leased lines, satellites, microwave links, or internet connections. WANs play a vital role in enabling large-scale data transmission, resource sharing, and communication between geographically dispersed locations, serving as the backbone of global connectivity and facilitating efficient information exchange on a grand scale. <a href="wan.html" target="_blank">more</a></p>

        <div>
            <h1> Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</h1>
            <p>A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is a type of network that covers a geographic area larger than a Local Area Network (LAN) but smaller than a Wide Area Network (WAN). Typically spanning a city or a large campus, a MAN connects multiple LANs and network devices within this intermediate-scale region. MANs use high-speed connectivity technologies like fiber optics and wireless connections to facilitate data exchange and communication between different locations within the metropolitan area. They serve as a valuable infrastructure for providing efficient and fast data transfer, enabling organizations and communities to share resources and information across relatively larger distances. <a href="man.html" target="_blank">more</a></p>

        <div>
            <h1>Local Area Network (LAN)</h1>
            <p>
                A network involves interconnected devices sharing resources and communication. A Local Area Network (LAN) is a specific network type localized within a confined area, such as a building or campus. It enables devices to efficiently share resources and communicate over a relatively short distance, typically spanning from a few hundred meters to a couple of kilometers. <a href="lan.html" target="_blank">more</a>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Personal Area Network (PAN)</h1>
            <p>A Personal Area Network (PAN) is a small-scale network that connects devices within a very limited and personal space, usually within a range of a few meters. It involves the interconnection of devices like smartphones, laptops, tablets, and peripherals such as Bluetooth headphones or wireless keyboards. PANs facilitate convenient data sharing and communication between these devices, often without the need for internet access. They are commonly used for tasks like file transfers, device synchronization, and simple communication between devices owned or controlled by an individual. <a href="pan.html" target="_blank">more</a></p>
