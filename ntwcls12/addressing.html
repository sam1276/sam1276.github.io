            Network Addresses

        <p>
            A network address is an identifier for a node or host on a telecommunications network. Network addresses are designed to be unique identifiers across the network, although some networks allow for local, private addresses, or locally administered addresses that may not be unique.

            MAC Address
        </h1>
        MAC Address (Media Access Control Address):
A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) of a device, such as a computer, smartphone, or network card. 
<br><br>
Unlike IP addresses, which can change based on network configuration, MAC addresses are typically hardcoded into the device's hardware and serve as a permanent hardware address. 
<br><br> 
MAC addresses are used at the data link layer of the OSI model to ensure that data packets are delivered to the correct device within the same local network (such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi networks).
<br><br>
MAC addresses are usually represented as a series of six pairs of hexadecimal digits, separated by colons or hyphens (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).

            IP Address
        </h1>
        <p>
            IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):
An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
<br><br>
 IP addresses play a crucial role in routing data packets across the internet and other networks. They help identify both the network and the specific device within that network.
 <br><br>
  IP addresses can be dynamic (assigned temporarily by a DHCP server) or static (manually configured and unchanging).
<br><br>
There are two main versions of IP addresses:
<br><br>
<span class="parash">IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)</span>: This is the most widely used version. IPv4 addresses consist of four sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.0.1). However, due to the limited number of available addresses, IPv4 has faced address exhaustion issues.
<br><br>
<span class="parash">IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)</span>: IPv6 was introduced to address the limitations of IPv4 and provide a much larger pool of IP addresses. IPv6 addresses are longer and use hexadecimal notation with colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

In summary, while both MAC addresses and IP addresses are used for identification and communication within computer networks, MAC addresses are tied to the hardware of a device and are used for local network communication, whereas IP addresses are used for routing data across networks, including the global internet.
