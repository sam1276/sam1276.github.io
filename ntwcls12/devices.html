            What are Network Devices
        </h1>
        <p>
            Network devices are hardware components or software applications that play crucial roles in the functioning
            of computer networks. These devices facilitate communication and data exchange between various devices, such
            as computers, servers, smartphones, and other networked devices. They help manage, route, and control the
            flow of data across the network infrastructure. Network devices can be categorized into several types based
            on their functions and roles within a network:

            NIC Card
        </h1>
        <p>
            A network interface card (NIC) is a hardware component without which a computer cannot be connected over a network. It is a circuit board installed in a computer that provides a dedicated network connection to the computer. It is also called network interface controller, network adapter or LAN adapter. <a href="">more</a>

            Routers
        </h1>
        <p>
            Routers are devices that connect different networks together and direct traffic between them. They operate
            at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and use routing tables to determine the best path for data
            packets to reach their destination. <a href="" target="_blank">more</a>

            Switches
        </h1>
        <p>
            Switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. They are used to connect devices within
            a local area network (LAN) and manage data traffic by forwarding data only to the specific device it's
            intended for, rather than broadcasting it to all devices on the network. <a href="" target="_blank">more</a>

            Hubs
        </h1>
        <p>
            Hubs, also operating at the data link layer, are simpler devices that receive data packets from one device
            and broadcast them to all devices connected to the hub. They are less efficient than switches because they
            don't manage traffic intelligently and can lead to network congestion. <a href="" target="_blank">more</a>

            Firewalls
        </h1>
        <p>
            Firewalls are security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They help protect networks from unauthorized access, malware, and other cyber threats. <a href="" target="_blank">more</a>

            Modems
         </h1>
         <p>
            Modems (short for modulator-demodulator) convert digital data from a computer into analog signals for transmission over telephone lines or other communication channels. They also convert incoming analog signals back into digital data. <a href="" target="_blank">more</a>

            Network Adapters
        </h1>
        <p>
            Network adapters, also known as network interface cards (NICs), are hardware components that allow devices to connect to a network. They provide the physical connection between a device and the network medium, such as Ethernet cables or wireless signals. <a href="" target="_blank">more</a>

            Gateways
        </h1>
        <p>
            Gateways are devices or software that facilitate communication between different networks using different protocols. They can perform protocol translation and data format conversion to enable interoperability between disparate networks. <a href="" target="_blank">more</a>
