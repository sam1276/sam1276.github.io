        <h1>What is Syntax</h1>
        <p>
            Syntax refers to the set of rules that dictate the structure and format of a programming language. It defines how individual symbols, keywords, and elements of the language should be arranged to form valid and meaningful programs. Proper syntax is essential for the interpreter or compiler to understand and execute the code correctly.
<br><br>
            In a programming language, syntax rules determine the correct usage of elements like variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, and more. Adhering to the language's syntax ensures that the code is written in a way that the computer can interpret and execute without errors.   
        </p>

    <div>
        <p>For example, in Python, the syntax for a basic "Hello, World!" program looks like this:
        </p>
        <div class="box"><code class="synt">
            print("Hello, World!")

        </code></div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The rules governing the placement of parentheses, quotation marks, and the print statement are part of Python's syntax. If the syntax is incorrect, the Python interpreter will raise a syntax error and prevent the code from running.
<br><br>
Different programming languages have their own unique syntax, and programmers must follow the specific rules of each language they are working with to write valid and functional programs. Understanding the syntax is a fundamental aspect of learning any programming language and is crucial for effective communication with the computer.
