        <h1>What is Python</h1>
    <p>1] Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity,
        readability, and versatility. <br>
        2] It is easy to learn and use, supports multiple programming paradigms, and comes with a large standard
        library. <br>
        3] Python's dynamic typing and portability make it popular for web development, data science, artificial
        intelligence, and more. <br>
        4] It is open-source, allowing the community to modify and distribute its source code freely.

    <h1>Key features of Python</h1>
    <p><span class="para-heading">Easy to Learn and Use</span>: Python's simple and intuitive syntax makes it accessible
        to beginners, allowing them to focus on problem-solving rather than getting bogged down by complex language
        details. <br>
        <span class="para-heading">Interpreted</span>: Python does not require compilation before execution; instead, it
        is executed line by line by the Python interpreter. This leads to quicker development and testing cycles. <br>
        <span class="para-heading">High-Level Language</span>: Python abstracts complex low-level details, making it
        more human-readable and reducing the need for managing system-specific details. <br>
        <span class="para-heading">Dynamic Typing</span>
        : Python uses dynamic typing, meaning variable types are determined at runtime. This makes it flexible but requires careful attention to variable types to avoid unexpected behavior. <br>
        <span class="para-heading">Multi-paradigm</span>
        : Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. <br>
        <span class="para-heading">Large Standard Library</span>
        : Python comes with a rich set of modules and libraries that cover a wide range of tasks, from working with data to web development. <br>
        <span class="para-heading">Open Source</span>
        : Python is open-source, which means its source code is freely available and can be modified and distributed by the community. <br>
        <span class="para-heading">Portability</span>
        : Python programs can run on various platforms and operating systems without modification, thanks to its high-level nature and the availability of interpreters for different environments.
