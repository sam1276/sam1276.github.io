    <h1>Database</h1>
    <p>
        A database is a structured storage system for organizing and managing data efficiently. It allows easy
        retrieval, updating, and manipulation of information.</p>

    <h1>Server</h1>
    <p>A server is a computer or software system that provides services or resources to other devices, responding to
        their requests.</p>
    <h1>Clint</h1>
    <p>A client is a device or software application that requests services or resources from a server and receives the
        responses containing the requested information.</p>

    <h1>SQL
    </h1>
    <p>
        SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational
        databases, enabling data retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion.
    </p>
    <h1>MySql</h1>
    <p>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL as its query language, widely
        used for web applications and various data-driven projects. <a href="#">Download Guide</a></p>
    <h1>
        Relational Data
    </h1>
    <p>Relational data is organized in structured tables with rows and columns, allowing relationships to be established
        between different tables based on shared data, commonly managed through SQL.</p>
    <h1>Relation Database</h1>
    <p>A relational database organizes data into tables with rows and columns, using SQL for data management. It allows
        efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of interconnected data.</p>
    <h1> Relational Database Model</h1>
    <p>The relational data model is a way of structuring data in tables with rows and columns, and establishing
        relationships between these tables based on shared data, facilitating efficient data management and retrieval.
        It is a fundamental concept in relational database management systems (RDBMS).</p>

    <h1>Components of Table
    </h1>
    <p class="littsp"><span class="subhd">Columns (Attributes)</span> <span class="para"> : Columns represent the
            individual data fields in the table, defining the type of data they can hold.</span><br></p>

    <p class="littsp"><span class="subhd">Rows (Records)</span><span class="para"> : Rows are the individual entries in
            the table, containing data related to specific entities or records.</span><br></p>

    <p class="littsp"><span class="subhd">Cells</span> : <span class="para"></span> Cells are the intersections of rows
        and columns, holding single values representing specific data.</span><br>
    </p>
    <p class="littsp"><span class="subhd">Primary Key</span><span class="para"> : A primary key is a unique identifier
            for each row, ensuring that each record can be uniquely identified and used for establishing relationships
            with other tables.</span>
    </p>

    <h1>Keys</h1>
    <p>Keys refer to specific columns or combinations of columns that play essential roles in defining the structure and
        relationships within a database.</p>
    <h2>Here are some common types of keys :</h2>

    <p class="littsp"><span class="subhd">Primary Key</span> <span class="para"> : A primary key is a unique identifier
            for each row in a table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and serves as a reference
            for establishing relationships with other tables.</span></p>
    <p class="littsp"><span class="subhd">Foregin Key</span> <span class="para"> : A foreign key is a column or set of
            columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It creates relationships between
            tables, enabling data integrity and data retrieval across related tables.</span></p>
    <p class="littsp"><span class="subhd">Candidate Key</span> <span class="para"> : A candidate key is a column or
            combination of columns that could potentially serve as a primary key. It must be unique and capable of
            uniquely identifying each row in the table.</span></p>
    <p class="littsp"><span class="subhd">Super Key</span> <span class="para"> : A super key is a set of one or more
            columns that, taken together, uniquely identify rows in a table. It may or may not be minimal in size,
            meaning it may contain more columns than needed to identify rows uniquely.</span></p>
    <p class="littsp"><span class="subhd">Composite Key</span> <span class="para"> : A composite key is a key that
            consists of multiple columns used together to uniquely identify rows in a table. It is an alternative to
            using a single column as the primary key..</span></p>

    <p>These keys play a crucial role in establishing relationships between tables and ensuring data integrity within a
        relational database. They are vital components for data retrieval, modification, and maintenance in a structured
        and efficient manner.</p>
