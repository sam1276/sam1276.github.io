        <p>Which of the following statements is FALSE about keys in a relational database?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="option">
        <p>a. Any candidate key is eligible to become a primary key. <br>
            b. A primary key uniquely identifies the tuples in a relation. <br>
            c. A candidate key that is not a primary key is a foreign key. <br>
            d. A foreign key is an attribute whose value is derived from the primary
            key of another relation.</p>

    <p>

        Option a (Any candidate key is eligible to become a primary key) is true. Any candidate key in a relation can be chosen as the primary key to uniquely identify the tuples in that relation.
<br><br>
Option b (A primary key uniquely identifies the tuples in a relation) is true. The primary key is a unique identifier for each tuple in the relation and ensures that no two tuples have the same key value.
<br><br>
Option c (A candidate key that is not a primary key is a foreign key) is false. A candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key is still a candidate key. A foreign key is an attribute in a relation that refers to the primary key of another relation, establishing a relationship between the two relations.
<br><br>
Option d (A foreign key is an attribute whose value is derived from the primary key of another relation) is true. A foreign key in one relation holds values that match the primary key of another relation, creating a link between the two relations and enabling referential integrity.
<br><br>
So, the FALSE statement is c. A candidate key that is not a primary key is a foreign key.
