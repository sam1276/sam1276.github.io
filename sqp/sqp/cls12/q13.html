        <p>
            A program can be syntactically correct, meaning it follows the proper syntax rules of the programming language. However, during runtime, unexpected situations or errors may occur, leading to the generation of exceptions. These exceptions can cause the program to halt or behave unexpectedly. Exception handling is used to address such situations and handle errors gracefully.
